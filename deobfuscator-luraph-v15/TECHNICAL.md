# Luraph v15 Deobfuscation & Devirtualization Internals

This document covers the technical architecture and reverse-engineering pipeline used by this engine to deobfuscate scripts protected with **Luraph v15**.

---

## 1. How Luraph v15 Works

Luraph v15 transforms original Luau scripts into an interpreted virtual machine:

1. **Virtual Instruction Set**: Original Luau bytecode is compiled into a custom register/stack machine with dynamic opcodes and encrypted dispatch tables.
2. **Flattened Control Flow**: Jump targets are flattened into a large state loop (`while true do local op = ARR[PC]; if-tree ... end`), masking the original high-level control structures (`while`, `repeat`, `for`, `if/else`).
3. **Lazy Constant Encryption**: String constants, numeric values, and jump destinations are encrypted in memory buffers (`LPH_ENCSTR`, `LPH_ENCFUNC`). They are only decrypted in-place when execution branches hit them.
4. **Anti-Tamper & Environment Traps**: The VM includes active probes against hook functions, stack depth alteration, and metatable inspection. If tampering is detected, it enters `LPH_CRASH()` (corrupting its own bytecode and spinning in an infinite loop).

## 2. Devirtualization Pipeline

To reconstruct valid, clean Luau source code, the engine executes a multi-pass pipeline:

```

### Stage 1: Static AST Parsing & Hooking (`vmmap.js`)
- The input script is parsed into a Luau AST using `luau-ast`.
- The engine identifies VM dispatch loops and closure maker functions.
- Non-invasive hooks are inserted into each closure maker to capture proto metadata, instruction arrays, and closure environments without changing execution behavior.
- A maker's proto/closure variables can read nil at the hook site (a maker invoked before the proto is assigned, or a dispatch-local maker reached on a setup path). Every hook key is therefore nil-guarded (`if (v)~=nil then __PF[v]=... end`, `__PA[pv]` behind `(pv)~=nil and ...`): a nil-keyed table write raises `table index is nil`, and because the hooks run *inside* the script it would abort the whole run before any `\0TRIGGER` could be reported, collapsing capture to a single proto. The guards keep both the JS (`src/vmmap.js`) and Python (`core/obfuscators/luraph_v15/driver.py`) instrumenters in sync; skipping a nil key only drops a maker call that was not creating a proto.

### Stage 2: Sandboxed Simulation & Trap Handling (`driver.js`, `harness.js`)
- The hooked script executes inside a sandboxed Luau runtime (`envlog.luau`).
- If an execution path hits an anti-tamper trap (`\0TRIGGER <pid>`), the engine identifies the responsible function, isolates it, and re-executes along stable code paths.
- **Compressed bootstrap variant.** Some Luraph v15 outputs ship a self-decompressing loader — `return setmetatable({ ..., q=[=[LPH$...]=], R={...}, V="Luraph Decompression Error: ", n=function(g) ... end }, {}):n()(...)` — whose `n` is a pure-Luau range-coder that `loadstring`s the real VM chunk. The sandbox captures that chunk through its `loadstring` hook (`\0CHUNK`), re-instruments it, and devirtualizes it like a top-level script, so no separate unpacking step is needed; detection scores these headerless loaders by the `setmetatable({`/`buffer.*`/`LPH` shape.

### Stage 3: Symbolic Execution & Live Memory Decryption (`devirt_bridge.py`, `driver.py`, `luasym.py`)
- The Node driver hands the trace to the Python core through `src/devirt_bridge.py` (one `pipeline` invocation per run; a big-stack thread protects the deep recursion).
- Each proto is analyzed using **Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation (SCCP)**.
- When the walker reaches lazy-encrypted constants, it queries the running Luau REPL server in memory (`harness.fetch`) via an IPC pipe.
- The REPL decrypts the values on-the-fly and returns them in milliseconds, resolving thousands of constants in a few fast rounds.

### Stage 4: Control Flow Graph (CFG) Reconstruction (`structure.py`, `loops.py`)
- The basic blocks identified during symbolic walking are assembled into a directed CFG.
- Dominator tree analysis identifies loops (`while true`, `for i = a, b, c`, `for k, v in pairs`) and conditionals (`if / elseif / else`).
- Unreachable dead blocks created by opaque predicates are pruned.

### Stage 5: Register Web Analysis & Local Naming (`variables.py`, `codegen.py`)
- Virtual registers are mapped across basic block boundaries using Static Single Assignment (SSA) web analysis.
- Variables are assigned clean local names inferred from Roblox API and global usage context (e.g., `Players`, `ReplicatedStorage`, `TweenService`).

### Stage 6: Polish & Formatting (`backend.py`, `tidy.js`)
- Function assignments are converted into idiomatic Luau (`local function name(...) ... end`).
- Code is formatted with proper indentation and verified through `compile_check` to ensure 100% executable syntax.

## 3. Fast-Path Optimization

In standard devirtualization, the final verification pass often repeats the entire analysis over all functions. This engine implements a **Fast-Path Controller**:
- Once all constants are resolved live with 0 unlifted blocks, the engine skips redundant collection passes and immediately triggers code generation.
- This cuts 40–60 seconds off the total execution time for massive scripts (500+ functions).

## 4. Environment Variables

Debug and tuning hooks used by the Python core and the Node driver. None are required; all default to off.

| Variable | Set by | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `PYTHON_BIN` | Node | Python executable the driver/bridge spawns (else `python3`, then `python`) |
| `JNKIE_KEY` | Node | Delivery-API key for jnkie loader chains without a `getgenv().SCRIPT_KEY` variable |
| `DEVIRT_WALK_LIMIT` | Python | SCCP walk budget per function (default `250000`; raised automatically for giant single-proto VMs) |
| `DEVIRT_LOADERS` | Python | Also lift loader/VM-constructor protos, not just the payload VM |
| `DEVIRT_FULL_ROUNDS` | Python | Disable quick constant-collection rounds; always run full lifts |
| `DEVIRT_REQS` | Python | Print every pending constant request per round |
| `DEVIRT_TIMING` | Python | Print per-stage timing and fetched-constant statistics |
| `DEVIRT_ERRS` | Python | Print per-block walk errors with proto ids |
| `DEVIRT_TB` | Python | Print full tracebacks for lifted-function errors (and attach one to the uncaught handler) |
| `DEVIRT_DEBUG` | Python | Dump decision logs, block structure and non-payload lifts to stderr |
| `DEVIRT_BLOCKS` | Python | Dump the CFG of the current function once (first hit only) |
| `DEVIRT_NO_MERGE` | Python | Skip `merge_equivalent` CFG simplification |
| `DEVIRT_NO_NAMES` | Python | Skip the local-name inference pass (`names.py`) |
| `DEOB_PROFILE` | Python | Write a cProfile dump of the `pipeline` branch to this path |
| `DEOB_PRETIDY` | Python | Write the pre-tidy trace text to this path |
| `DEOB_SPIN_LATE` | Python | Do not patch the spin watchdog into the script before the first run |
| `DEOB_NO_SERVE` | Python | Disable the long-lived serve harness (always re-run from scratch) |
| `DEOB_NO_FETCH` | Python | Disable live constant fetching inside the serve harness |
| `DEOB_SERVE_DIFF` | Python | Dump the served vs. run trace texts for comparison |

## 5. Cross-Language Protocol Constants

The harness protocol is shared by three languages: the Python core builds the
harness file, the Node driver parses its output, and the Luau runtime
(`runtime/envlog.luau`) prints it. All protocol constants live in
**`protocol.json`** at the repo root:

- chunk-key hash parameters (`h*31+b` over latin-1 bytes, 4096-byte stride and minimum length) used by `harness.chunk_key`, `harness.js chunkKey` and envlog's `srcKey`;
- the per-run nonce length (`8` bytes, printed as 16 hex chars) that tags every `\0` protocol line;
- heartbeat (2 s) and stall (20 s) watchdog timings;
- the marker name list (`PROTOS`, `TRIGGER`, `CHUNK`, `ENVLOG-BEGIN`, ...).

`runtime/envlog.luau` carries the same values baked into its `local PROTO = {...}`
line (standalone Studio runs depend on them). Both harness builders overwrite
that line from `protocol.json` on every run, and `test/protocol_test.py` fails
CI when any copy drifts. If you change a protocol value, change it in
`protocol.json` only.

## 6. Testing & CI

- `npm test` (or `python test/run_all.py`) runs the fast suite: unit tests for the Python core (chunk-key vectors, Luau pow semantics, config parsing, protocol nonce forging regression) plus the cross-language protocol consistency checks (spawns `node`, no Luau binaries needed).
- `python test/run_all.py --golden` additionally re-runs the full pipeline on the benchmark samples and compares byte-for-byte with the committed reference outputs in `sample/output/` (needs `bin/luau` + `bin/luau-ast` from `python build_luau.py`). If a run differs, the reference file is restored and the test fails.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the fast suite on Ubuntu and Windows, syntax-checks every Python/JS file, and builds the patched Luau runtime (cached) for the golden regression.
