## 2026-10-05 — monorepo toolchain revival + blocker-map refresh (lf149 is GONE)

Session scope (user): "Continue". The project now lives in the **`luadevirt`
monorepo** (`Aditya-lua/luadevirt`), FlowAuth under `flowauth-deobfuscator/`, the
sandbox repo as the sibling `deobfuscator-luraph-v15/` (lowercase). The old
handoff/`progress.md` paths (`/home/z/my-project/…`) no longer exist here.

**Root cause (toolchain was dead on this machine).** The root-level devirt/lift
probes still hardcoded `MAIN = "/home/z/my-project/Deobfuscator-Luraph-V15"` at
import time → `ModuleNotFoundError`, nothing ran. The chain drivers had already
been de-hardcoded (2026-09-30 via `flowauth_loader.find_repo`); the root probes
were missed.

**Fix (minimal, matches the prior de-hardcoding).**
- New `_repo_path.py` (`main_repo()`): delegates to `flowauth_loader.find_repo`
  (explicit → `FLOWAUTH_REPO` → sibling/home scan, both CamelCase + lowercase
  basenames) and puts the repo's `core/` on `sys.path`. `find_repo` already scans
  the parent dir, so from `flowauth-deobfuscator/` it finds the sibling.
- Routed `devirt_full.py`, `lift_new_capture.py`, `lift_flowauth_payload.py`,
  `probe_progress.py` through `main_repo()`; fixed `patch_payload.js` to resolve
  the sibling relatively (`__dirname`/`FLOWAUTH_REPO`) instead of absolute paths.
- Added fresh-clone `SRC` fallbacks (work/ is gitignored → fall back to the
  tracked `flowauth_capture/payload_devirt.lua`), same pattern as
  `reassemble_payload.py`.

**Verified live in this container** (16 GB RAM, luau runs — no SIGILL here):
1. Round-1 lift from the tracked capture reproduces **53 fns** (now 10,069 B; the
   sibling lifter has advanced since the 8,837 B tracked reference — same 53 fns).
2. Grind-kill capture regenerated offline from the tracked payload
   (`DEVIRT_TRACE_DEBUG=1 python3 devirt_full.py`): clean abort rc=0 at ~35 s,
   **163 MB dump = 423,934 protos**, trace shows the real UI builder
   (`UIScale`, `UISizeConstraint`, `Vector2.new(25,1)`) — matches §6 exactly.
3. New-capture lift (`lift_new_capture.py`) runs end-to-end → 46,050 B, parses
   (luau-ast OK), 1 root (t141697, 423,934 caps).

**Blocker-map refresh (important — §8 is partly stale).** The handoff's headline
blocker **"call of unknown VM function lf149" (env-slot helper binding) is GONE** —
the current sibling lifter binds those helpers. Remaining error markers on the
single-root lift (57 total): **48× `index nil`** (lazy/encrypted constant slots
the single trace never decoded — cluster on offsets `272,644812` and
`272,676217`), **9× `arith on None None`** (arithmetic on those unresolved
constants), **1× `closure maker did not return`** (the wrapper factory, §8 #2 —
now a single site). `requests=0`: `lift_new_capture.py` does a single static pass.

**Still pending (the real next wave, unchanged in substance):**
- Lazy constants → run the full `devirt_full.py main()` pipeline (`ldrv.run`,
  constant rounds) so the sandbox decodes the requested slots and the index-nil /
  arith-None markers clear.
- The real payload logic (the UI builders) lives in the **20 entered child
  protos**, not the single root; they need lifting + splicing
  (`DEVIRT_SHALLOW` / `tools/lift_all.py` approach from the RaceforEggs note).
- Wrapper factory: follow the wrapper → inner VM closure for the one remaining site.

## 2026-09-30 — generalized the fetcher: fetch the obfuscated payload for ANY loader URL

Session scope (user): "make my FlowAuth fetcher actually be able to fetch actual
obfuscated code from any flowauth url" (example `29f4f4b9…`).

**Problem (root cause).** The fetcher was hardwired to one script and one stale
capture, so it could not fetch an arbitrary `/v1/loaders/<md5>.lua`:
1. both drivers hardcoded `REPO = /home/z/my-project/Deobfuscator-Luraph-V15` at
   *import time* → `ImportError`/exit off that one machine;
2. the run needed a **pre-placed** `work/runtime_marbeg.lua` + `work/bootstrapper.lua`
   for one specific script — nothing fetched the stage-2 runtime for a new URL;
3. the tracked runtime is **stale**: `29f4f4b9…` now serves sha `48a019dd…` / **598455 B**
   (was `87c8738e…` / 586282 B), so even the original URL was broken;
4. plain GETs get a 266 B decoy ("automated source fetching is not allowed") — the
   real loader only comes back with `User-Agent: Roblox/Win32` + `X-FlowAuth-Protocol: 3`.

**Fix.**
- New `flowauth_crack/flowauth_loader.py` (stdlib-only, independently testable): the
  generalizable front-half — `fetch_loader` (Roblox UA + decoy detection),
  `parse_loader` (decode escapes → stage-2 URL candidates, expected size, Adler
  target, both `_bsdata0` handoffs, md5), `adler_flow` (the loader's 8-byte-stepped
  checksum), `fetch_runtime` (try primary/pinned/retry/IP-fallback, verify size +
  checksum), `find_repo` (auto-discover the sandbox repo via `--repo`/`FLOWAUTH_REPO`/
  sibling + shallow scan), `build_bootstrapper` (shared wrapper).
- `flowauth_two_phase.py` reworked into a true any-URL fetcher: discover repo → fetch
  loader → download+verify runtime → build bootstrapper → patch envlog with the fresh
  handoff → run the proven live serve/plant/resume loop → reassemble → write
  `work/<md5>.payload.lua`. Import-time hardcoding gone.
- `patch_envlog.py`, `flowauth_chain.py`, `gen_boot.py`: removed hardcoded repo path
  (now `find_repo`); `gen_boot.py` + `flowauth_chain.py` reuse the shared builder and
  point at the current example URL.

**Verified live in this container** (cloud, luau sandbox from the sibling repo):
full from-scratch fetch of `29f4f4b9…` → fresh loader (9690 B) → verified 598455 B
runtime → 4 live hops (challenge → script → payload×2) → reassembled **713630 B**
(server `source_bytes` match), head `LRM_ScriptName="Flow Loader"`, Luraph v15 banner
present. Output: `work/29f4f4b924aff467652814456286bb05.payload.lua`.

**Run it (any URL):**
```bash
export FLOWAUTH_REPO=/path/to/Deobfuscator-Luraph-V15   # or let it auto-discover
python3 flowauth_crack/flowauth_two_phase.py --loader-url https://flowauth.net/v1/loaders/<md5>.lua
# raw obfuscated payload -> flowauth_crack/work/<md5>.payload.lua
```

## 2026-09-29 (evenest) — RaceforEggs (v14.9) direct devirt: 119/119 protos lifted

Session scope (user): "this session should be only devirtualizing luraph v15 scripts" +
"Only give me lurapi v15 code behind it". Ran the user's RaceforEggs URL through the
DIRECT Luraph pipeline (not the FlowAuth chain).

**Deliverable:** `/home/z/my-project/download/RaceforEggs.devirtualized.lua`
(9.5k lines, all 119 captured protos lifted, 0 lift failures, 17 residual error
markers = paths whose constants the sandbox trace never decoded).

**v14.9 lifter fixes landed in Deobfuscator-Luraph-V15 this session:**
1. `value_of`: hash-keyed VM tables now render as table constructors (`table_ctor`)
   instead of raising "storing a non-empty VM table" (config tables `{url=...}` are
   everywhere in real scripts).
2. `_locs_lt`: total-order comparison for carried-locals tuples (int/None mixing
   crashed the backward-jump hub test).
3. `MAX_STACK_DEPTHS` limiter now keys on the stack-POINTER value, not the whole
   locs tuple — object-carrying states (decryptor Bufs, OpaqueFns) no longer
   exhaust the depth budget spuriously. Error markers 64 → 17 on RaceforEggs.
4. Walk `edges`/`pred` dicts are now walk-LOCAL (nothing ever read them) — holding
   them through `lower()` was the main OOM driver on deep proto chains.
5. `sys.intern` on `fmt_expr` output + `_carry_key` strings (state keys repeat
   these by the million) + periodic `gc.collect()` in `closure()`.

**OOM lesson (deep chains):** a single in-process lift of a ~119-deep nested proto
chain holds every ancestor's IR alive during `lower()` and OOMs a 4 GB container
(~85 % at depth ~65-81, two runs died). Fix = `DEVIRT_SHALLOW=1` (children become
`__DEVIRT_CHILD__(p<pid>|t<tid>)` markers) + `tools/lift_all.py` which lifts every
captured proto SEQUENTIALLY (walk state is walk-local now) and splices the markers
recursively. `tools/lift_child.py` lifts one tid standalone.

**Renderer guard:** `codegen.Renderer.lvalue` renders Const/raw-int assign targets
(a numeric-for recognition side effect) as `__SLOT_N__` so the output always parses
(luau-ast verified).

**Golden regression caveat (pre-existing, NOT from these changes):** at main-repo
HEAD e24ecb1 the two RUN_GOLDEN samples (5ae…, RideAPet) do not reproduce their
committed references IN THIS CONTAINER — the sandbox trace dies with
"table index is nil" (5ae = FlowAuth-protected loader; flowauth.net now 403s plain
GETs; RideAPet's loadstring'd chunk errors identically on the CLEAN tree). The goldens
were generated from the later lost luarmor commits (a5dcd4c/01ebbbd, wiped by a
container reset before push). With the session's changes the lifts COMPLETE where the
clean tree failed outright ("call of unknown VM function lf1"); npm test 36/36 green.

## 2026-09-29 (later) — ROUND-2: the grind is SOLVED, full capture obtained

**This is the big one.** All previous capture attempts (capture_v3/v4, /tmp/fresh_raw*.txt)
died with 0 bytes: the payload has an anti-analysis grind that OOMs the sandbox
(~80 MB/s, 3.6 GB in <60 s, SIGKILL, no output).

**Root cause chain (fully mapped, see FLOWAUTH_HANDOFF.md §6):**
1. `driver.patch_spin` regex matches **0 loop heads** in this build (`while true do
   if not(x<=15)then…` shape) → spin watchdog completely dead.
2. The one entry hook fires once (its `%128` gate skips the check; never re-runs).
3. The script swallows Lua-string errors via real pcall (envlog passes `E.pcall = R.pcall`
   on purpose — Luraph fingerprints the stack).
4. newP proxy abort never fires (grind allocates raw Lua objects, not proxies).
5. ulimit -v → GC-thrash forever at ~505 MB, still no clean exit.
6. ACTUAL mechanism: after the root enters the tamper-check fn (pid 3), a tamper-response
   handler loops INSIDE one VM instruction (dispatch head never re-executes).

**THE FIX** (`devirt_full.py`): inject `__SPIN` counting into EVERY `while true do` head
(65 sites): `re.subn(r"\bwhile true do ", ... + "if __SPIN then __SPIN.n=__SPIN.n+1;if
__SPIN.n>=__SPIN.step then __SPIN.f()end;end;", src)`. Clean abort at t≈30 s, rc=0,
full wrap-up: **164 MB dump = 423,934 protos / 428,962 tables / 20 entered pids / 695 lf
values** (vs 64 protos from the old capture). Trace proves real code ran: UI builders
(`Instance.new("UIScale")`, `TextButton2`, `UISizeConstraint`, `Vector2.new(25,1)`…).

**New artifacts:** `devirt_full.py` (full pipeline + grind kill + DEVIRT_TRACE_DEBUG mode),
`lift_new_capture.py` (staged lift), `flowauth_crack/work/payload_full.protos.json.gz`
(7.9 MB), `payload_full.trace.txt`, `FLOWAUTH_HANDOFF.md` (master handoff + continuous
paste-able prompt).

**Remaining lift blockers (precisely diagnosed, §8 of handoff):**
- env-slot helper binding: env table t10 (cap field A, 61 slots) holds runtime-helper
  closures, filled dynamically (no static `A[49]=function`), never bound by devirt.py's
  cap-field-only binding loop → "call of unknown VM function lf149" at stepper init.
- wrapper factory: symbolic factory returns a wrapper, not the VM closure (devirt.py:740).
- entered pids → caps at tid+1 (pid 1→t339806 root, 3→t8418, 4→t63, … — full list §8).
- Next: record the maker's symbolic-exec puts into A as (slot→node) bindings; follow the
  wrapper to the inner VM closure; lift the 20 entered protos.

**Env quirks that cost hours** (now in handoff §9): luau stdout block-buffered (killed
process = 0 B output); background processes reaped between tool calls (run foreground);
3.9 GB RAM box (grind OOMs the whole machine).

## 2026-09-29 — fresh capture on request loader `29f4f4b9…` (READY status confirmed)

**Status: pipeline READY for new script URLs.** Ran `flowauth_two_phase.py` live against
`https://flowauth.net/v1/loaders/29f4f4b924aff467652814456286bb05.lua` from a fresh clone
state. Full chain succeeded in ONE luau process:

1. `[0]` fresh loader fetched: 9,688 B, handoff seeds `1411393296 626746395` (session-refreshed)
2. envlog sandbox patched (306,573 B), harness built (1.2 MB), bootstrapper 586,598 B
3. hop 1 → `POST /v1/auth/challenge` → **200** (protocol 3, `credential_mode: loader`)
4. hop 2 → `POST /v1/auth/script` → **200** (`runtime_keys.onyx-v1: 4e52a512…`)
5. hop 3 → `POST /v1/auth/payload` → **200** (524,313 B chunk, token `H0i524fZ…`)
6. hop 4 → `POST /v1/auth/payload` → **200** (260,733 B chunk, token `uLuWONEE…`)
7. loop finished mode=end; runtime's own in-sandbox lz4 step errored
   (`FlowAuth: payload could not be decompressed`) — expected; python-side reassembly bypasses it
8. `reassemble_payload.py`: chunks 393,216 + 195,530 → **713,630 B payload**
   (server-confirmed size), LRM prelude head (`LRM_ScriptName="Flow Loader"`)
9. **fresh vs tracked payload: same 713,630 B, 289 bytes differ (0.040%)** — per-session
   watermarks only, `payload_digest` is session-keyed (not plain sha256) — captures stay valid
10. lift on fresh payload: **53 functions / 8,837 B** → `flowauth_capture/payload_lift.lua`

**Fixed this session** (fresh-clone bug): `reassemble_payload.py` derived an empty 76-byte
Luraph banner header when `work/payload_devirt.lua` didn't exist yet (work/ is gitignored),
producing a devirt input the lifter parsed as 0 functions. Now falls back to the tracked
`flowauth_capture/payload_devirt.lua` header. Committed.

**Fresh-clone bootstrap** (what was needed from empty `work/`):
```bash
# 1. stage-2 runtime (session-independent, sha256 content-addressed):
python3 tools/fetch_stage2.py   # or any curl of the /assets/flowauth/sha256/<hash>/… URL
#    → put it at flowauth_crack/work/runtime_marbeg.lua
# 2. generate bootstrapper (needs main repo core on PYTHONPATH):
PYTHONPATH=/home/z/my-project/Deobfuscator-Luraph-V15/core python3 gen_boot.py
# 3. run the chain (default loader-url is the 29f4f4b9… one):
python3 flowauth_two_phase.py 24 --loader-url https://flowauth.net/v1/loaders/<md5>.lua
# 4. reassemble + lift:
python3 reassemble_payload.py && python3 lift_flowauth_payload.py
```

**Housekeeping:** a stray duplicate repo `Aditya-lua/flowauth-devirt` was created earlier
this session by mistake (context loss) — the real standalone repo is THIS one
(`FlowAuth-Deobfuscator`, split in commit `70a6b45` of the main repo). Delete
`flowauth-devirt` if the API couldn't.

**Ready to accept:** any `flowauth.net/v1/loaders/<md5>.lua` URL — chain + capture + lift
run unattended. Next devirt wave (unchanged): junk-guard walk errors, unbound helpers
(`lf141`/`lf155`), vararg rendering, lazy constants via live-fetch loop.

## 2026-09-28 — session-independent chain + parameterized loader (commit 7210e6f)

- Chain proven end-to-end twice in separate sessions; only 277 watermark bytes differ
  between sessions → `payload_digest` is session-keyed, captures valid across sessions.
- `flowauth_two_phase.py` takes `--loader-url` (any `/v1/loaders/<md5>.lua`) — ready for
  new scripts.
- Robust reassembly committed.

## 2026-09-28 — FlowAuth split into its own repo (commit 70a6b45, da76083)

- All FlowAuth tooling moved out of Deobfuscator-Luraph-V15 → **FlowAuth-Deobfuscator**.
- Main repo keeps: sandbox harness (`runtime/envlog.luau`), `bin/luau`, generic devirt core.
- Tracked capture: `flowauth_capture/` (payload_source.lua 713,630 B, protos 64 / 4,986
  tables, hop responses, round-1 lift 53 fns).
